### Hello there. ðŸ‘‹

####  My name is Jayanth Krishnamurthy, and I am currently studying as a senior in Data Science at Purdue University. I have sufficient experience working in Python, Java, R, MySQL, and I have also worked in Neo4j and MongoDB. After completing my Bachelor's Degree, I am working on getting a full-time position at a large-scale company, and eventually getting my Master's degree in Data Science later on.
